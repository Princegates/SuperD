-- SuperD: a driver could tap "Undo" to revert a delivery from 'delivered'
-- back to 'picked_up' even after the customer already handed over the
-- completion PIN to confirm receipt (0056_delivery_completion_pin.sql) -
-- the client already offered this as a menu option (previousForDriver
-- included 'delivered' -> 'picked_up'), and nothing server-side stopped
-- it either. Once the PIN has done its job, there's nothing left to
-- legitimately "undo by mistake".
--
-- Fixed on both sides: the client no longer offers "Undo" once a
-- delivery is 'delivered' (DeliveryStatus.previousForDriver), and this
-- migration adds the server-side backstop so it can't be bypassed by
-- any other code path - same pattern already used for the frozen-driver
-- and PIN checks in this same function. Scoped to the driver's own
-- client only, same as those - a dispatcher/admin correcting a status
-- from the Console is unaffected.
